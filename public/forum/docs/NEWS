	* Tagging 5.2.10

   2009-01-23 22:01  ts77
	* fix for an XSS issue reported by Mark Gordon

   2008-12-30 18:30  brian
	* Fixed lightweight read template. There was an extra close div in
	  the attachments section making the rest of the page break out of
	  the main phorum div

   2008-12-09 08:52  ts77
	* added experimental attachment support to the smtp-mail module

   2008-12-06 10:56  mmakaay
	* Close the database connection explicitly at the end of the Phorum
	  script, to prevent lingering MySQL connections from overloading
	  the MySQL server.

   2008-11-26 14:51  mmakaay
	* Oops...I fixed it again.

   2008-11-26 14:48  mmakaay
	* Straightened out the moderation thread hooks. The hook "hide" is
	  now called "hide_thread" to be in harmony with the other thread
	  moderation hooks. Thanks to Joe Curia for noting the
	  inconsistency.

   2008-11-23 23:50  brian
	* Attempted fix for #802, <hr> tag was not having newlines trimmed
	  after it

   2008-11-23 23:22  brian
	* Fix for #808, rebuild script not rebuilding all the threads

   2008-11-23 19:04  brian
	* Fixes for ticket #791, phorum 3 upgrade issues with character set

   2008-11-23 15:55  brian
	* Fix for ticket #766, Group moderation bug

   2008-11-19 15:05  mmakaay
	* Improved the JSON handling using the PEAR library on systems that
	  do not implement json_encode() and/or json_decode(). Thanks to
	  Phorum user "rasta" for the coding idea.

   2008-11-13 09:05  mmakaay
	* Reverted [3700]: allow_email_notify is a per-forum setting and not
	  a global settin. Therefore, the control center should not hide the
	  "follow+mail" option if email_notify is not enabled when loading
	  the control center page.

   2008-11-13 08:59  mmakaay
	* Hide the "follow + email" option from default follow mode
	  configuration in the user control center when email notifications
	  are disabled by the admin.

   2008-11-12 19:26  mmakaay
	* Removed content-type header from the smileys javascript code. It
	  is no longer needed now the javascript is incorporated from
	  javascript.php.

   2008-11-12 16:35  mmakaay
	* Suppress possible warnings from a file_exists() call in the Spam
	  Hurdles module.

   2008-11-07 12:39  ts77
	* ignore some more settings on inheritance (fixing #809, thanks to
	  _noe_ ) ...

   2008-11-07 12:29  ts77
	* fixed db-upgrade scripts for replicated setups (fixing #813,
	  thanks to Mathias)

   2008-11-07 12:23  ts77
	* added masterquery-flags to event-logging module (fixing #814,
	  thanks to Mathias for reporting and providing a patch)

   2008-11-07 12:03  ts77
	* removed the message about the closed thread in the read page in
	  case "reply on separate page" and added an error message in the
	  posting form instead of just redirecting (closing #817)

   2008-11-07 00:54  mmakaay
	* Obfuscate mail addresses that are displayed by the bbcode module.

   2008-11-06 21:50  mmakaay
	* Fixed the fallback-to-pear-json option in the JSON API code.

   2008-11-03 05:50  brian
	* Fix for #805

   2008-10-31 19:33  mmakaay
	* Fixed the PHP json extension detection code in case the json API
	  code was loaded from within a function. The fallback PEAR JSON
	  library would not be triggered if the json extension was missing
	  in the PHP setup.

   2008-10-26 16:08  brian
	* Added ability to add a user from the admin. Thanks to Azumandias
	  for the initial patch

   2008-10-14 07:40  mmakaay
	* Fixed a problem in the phorum_api_file_store() function call,
	  which could cause storing a file with a message or user to fail.
	  This had no effect on the existing core Phorum code by sheer luck,
	  but when using the API call, things might go wrong, depending on
	  the order in which the file info fields were stored in the $file
	  argument.

   2008-10-13 07:24  mmakaay
	* Fixed a problem in the BBcode module, which could cause the
	  "Activation of bbcode tags" section of the module's settings
	  screen to be empty.

   2008-10-06 10:13  ts77
	* removed "SET CHARACTER SET" query to solve some mysteries in
	  charset support (thanks to Chris who brought this up
	  http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?61,132926,132926 )

   2008-10-06 10:03  mmakaay
	* Fixed #806: possible XSS leak plugged. This was reported as a
	  security vulnerability, however we were never able to produce
	  anything more than broken HTML code. Since broken HTML code is not
	  good and because we are rather safe than sorry, this fix was
	  implemented.

   2008-10-04 08:55  mmakaay
	* Fixed "AND" based queries for
	  phorum_api_user_search_custom_profile_field(). Thanks to Phorum
	  user jjarvis98 for noticing the bug and to Azumandias for
	  providing the fix.

   2008-09-21 10:10  ts77
	* transferring template-arg through the urls (fixing #792), doesn't
	  work with search - essentially breaks search and needs checking
	  therefore

   2008-09-21 09:56  ts77
	* give a message about this being a moderated forum before
	  redirecting after posting (fixing #775)

   2008-09-02 12:13  mmakaay
	* Fixed the new release detection code. In the admin interface, new
	  releases were not detected by the "Check For New Version"
	  function.

   2008-09-01 09:55  mmakaay
	* Fixed #797: Undefined offset: 0 in api.php in case the message
	  started with a stale BBcode close tag. Thanks to Alexey Torkhov
	  for the problem report.

   2008-09-01 09:37  mmakaay
	* Fixed #796: Undefined index "mod_bbcode_tags" in BBcode module.
	  Thanks to Alexey Torkhov for the heads up.

   2008-09-01 07:41  mmakaay
	* Fixed the classic index style (directory browsing mode) for the
	  classic 0.4 template. It did not yet reflect a change in the
	  datastructures that we use for the index page in Phorum 5.2,
	  causing folders to not show up in that view.

   2008-09-01 06:33  mmakaay
	* Fix for #795: BBcode module needs to explicitly include api.php to
	  define the constants that are used in the settings page. Thanks to
	  Alexey Torkhov for the heads up.

   2008-08-27 12:57  ts77
	* building the list of forums to move a thread to in the same way as
	  the list of forums in the search form (fixing #729, thx to Oliver
	  Riesen)

   2008-08-27 10:09  mmakaay
	* Fixed #784: missing terminating ] for character class in
	  http_get.php.

   2008-08-23 18:31  mmakaay
	* Fixed #776: phorum_api_user_save() sets the password to "*NO
	  PASSWORD SET*" when calling the function twice (first time to
	  create a user, second time to update, both calls without using a
	  password in the user data). Thanks to Alexey Torkhov for finding
	  and reporting the issue.

   2008-08-22 22:55  mmakaay
	* Fixed #787: BBcode module: end of message end tags for some bbcode
	  tags were not processed correctly. The tag and the text that came
	  before the tag were duplicated at the end of the rendered message.

   2008-08-22 21:21  mmakaay
	* Added "@" as a safe character for the quoted printable encoding
	  requirement check. Otherwise, every mail address will be quoted
	  printable encoded, even if there are no special characters in it.

   2008-08-04 17:57  mmakaay
	* Phorum3 script updated for the new phorum_db_file_save() call in
	  Phorum 5.2. Thanks to Simon King who posted the patch in our
	  support forums.

   2008-07-22 07:23  mmakaay
	* Suppress output from the memcache cache layer for cases where
	  connecting to the memcached server fails. This prevents memcached
	  problems from breaking the page ("headers already sent".)
	  Additionally, the inline documentation was updated.

   2008-07-18 13:28  mmakaay
	* Fixed #772: possible corruption of serialized custom field data
	  (reported by Jonhoo).

   2008-07-15 18:11  brian
	* Fix for #731. Strip DESCRIPTION for search page

   2008-07-04 16:48  ts77
	* use display_name for reporter as suggested by Oliver Riesen
	  (fixing #761)

   2008-07-04 15:49  ts77
	* same date formatting in read templates as suggested by Oliver
	  Riesen (#749)

   2008-07-02 18:39  mmakaay
	* Fixed an incompatibility between file downloads with the "only
	  from this forum" restriction, in combination with URI
	  authentication. Before this fix, access for downloading the image
	  would be denied, even though the file was downloaded directly from
	  the forum. # Also a typo-fix-of-the-day change (learned that it is
	  "existent" :-).

   2008-07-01 14:30  mmakaay
	* Fixed a compatibility problem between the new BBcode module and
	  PHP versions prior to 5.1.0. The PHP function
	  htmlspecialchars_decode() is not available for those versions of
	  PHP. Thanks to Adam for noticing the problem and for providing a
	  work-around!

   2008-06-25 21:14  ts77
	* fixed undefined index in event_logger module (#748, reported by
	  Oliver Riesen)

   2008-06-25 21:07  ts77
	* stripped quotes from plain-text forum description as suggested by
	  Oliver Riesen (#743)

   2008-06-25 20:53  ts77
	* added line-height for thread options as suggested by Oliver Riesen
	  (#730)

   2008-06-25 20:20  ts77
	* made users tz_offset a float value for non-integer timezones

   2008-06-17 11:19  mmakaay
	* The "Force hiding of email addresses" option is now only
	  applicable to regular forum users. Administrators and moderators
	  can always see the email addresses of the users. For moderators,
	  this can be restricted by setting the PHORUM_MOD_EMAIL_VIEW
	  constant to false in include/constants.php. Some more fine grained
	  control for email address displaying will be added to Phorum 5.3.

   2008-06-16 10:15  ts77
	* quote anonymous authors with their name (fixing #744)

   2008-06-16 09:59  ts77
	* sort strictly by datestamp to get the recent_post (fixing #755)

   2008-06-16 09:32  ts77
	* added user's posts to edit screen (readonly), fixing #759

   2008-06-16 09:06  mmakaay
	* Another fix for #765: UTF-8 byte order markers at the start of
	  template files are now stripped by include/templates.php.

   2008-06-16 08:20  mmakaay
	* Fix for #765: catch the output of include files
	  (include/db/config.php, include/lang/* and
	  templates/*/settings.tpl) to prevent extra output like UTF-8 byte
	  order markers from breaking the pages.

   2008-06-13 18:28  ts77
	* case insensitive search for block tags in html module (fixing
	  #760)

   2008-06-05 00:21  mmakaay
	* Implemented some improvements for the Editor Tools module as
	  suggested by David King (phorum.org user "Optimal") and Oliver
	  Riesen. The behavior when adding tags using the buttons is now
	  much better. The textarea won't scroll up anymore if it is
	  scrolled downwards a bit and the text that was selected previously
	  to adding the tag will be reselected after adding the tag.

   2008-06-03 09:41  mmakaay
	* Fixed a bug in handling stale close tags that directly follow
	  another open or close tag. Thanks to CBiLL for the problem report.
	  The related error message was: Unsupported operand types in
	  [..]/bbcode/api.php

   2008-06-02 08:09  mmakaay
	* Fix for #762: moved pm_sent hook to always trigger the hook after
	  a sent PM. Before, it would not trigger if the PM mail
	  notification was disabled.

   2008-05-27 20:34  mmakaay
	* Improved handling of stale close tags in the text and fixed a PHP
	  undefined index warning along with it. Thanks to CBiLL for the
	  problem report.

   2008-05-25 22:58  mmakaay
	* MFT: # Undefined indexes fixed.

   2008-05-25 11:57  mmakaay
	* Added the conference 2008 rewrite release of the BBcode module to
	  the tree.

   2008-05-25 09:35  mmakaay
	* Added javascript_filter hook (for things like javascript
	  compression). Added a refresh=1 parameter for javascript.php to
	  let it ignore the cache.

   2008-05-19 15:51  mmakaay
	* The javascript.php script automatically loads the Ajax client
	  code, so modules can be sure that they can make use of it and
	  don't have to load it specifically. Templates can now contain a
	  "javascript.tpl", which is loaded in by the javascript.php code
	  automatically. This corresponds to the way that the CSS code works
	  (where you can create a "css.tpl").

   2008-05-13 03:51  ataylor
	* Added File Path block

   2008-05-08 15:00  mmakaay
	* Added a new API layer for handling JSON data (final goal: Ajax
	  layer)

   2008-05-08 14:56  mmakaay
	* Added a new API layer for newflags handling.

   2008-05-03 13:53  mmakaay
	* Backported the phorum_switch_template() function from trunk to
	  5.2. This new function makes it possible to switch the active
	  Phorum template to a template that is stored in any directory.
	  This is for example useful if a module includes a full Phorum
	  template, where the template is packaged with the module code.
	  With this new function, the Phorum can activate the module's
	  template without the need for the admin to copy the template to
	  the main templates directory.

   2008-04-29 16:41  mmakaay
	* Fixed #740: Mark read in folder (classic index) goes back to root
	  (thanks Oliver!)

   2008-04-29 16:03  mmakaay
	* Fixed #754: Display name filter was not included in pagination
	  (thanks Oliver!)

   2008-04-29 16:01  mmakaay
	* Fixed #738: problems with German help file for smileys module
	  (thanks Oliver!)

   2008-04-29 15:54  mmakaay
	* Fixed #757: Fixed typo in hook call for "posting_permissions"
	  (thanks Alexey)

   2008-04-17 15:24  ts77
	* use the correct default language for announcement conversion
	  (fixing #734)

   2008-04-03 08:42  mmakaay
	* Fixed #735: Added missing backslash in JavaScript code (thanks to
	  Oliver Riesen)

   2008-03-23 00:24  mmakaay
	* Fixed spam flagging by SpamAssassin for rule
	  SUBJECT_NEEDS_ENCODING. This prevents spam flagging of mail in
	  case the admin uses a name that contains special characters in the
	  "System Emails From Name" field. Encoding was implemented using
	  the Quoted-Printable description from RFC 2045.

   2008-03-21 11:25  mmakaay
	* Fixed spam flagging by SpamAssassin for rule FROM_BLANK_NAME
	  (From: contains empty name). This prevents spam flagging of mail
	  in case the admin did not fill in the "System Emails From Name"
	  field. This resulted in a header like: From: ""
	  <admin@example.com>

   2008-03-21 11:16  mmakaay
	* Fixed spam flagging by SpamAssassin for rule MSGID_FROM_MTA_HEADER
	  (Message-Id was added by a relay). This prevents spam flagging of
	  mail messages that are not sent for new message notification (for
	  those we already generated a Message-Id header).

   2008-03-19 19:24  ts77
	* clear html-description for profile page (fixing #723)

   2008-03-10 15:33  mmakaay
	* Fix for #712: Quote tag removes newline after first line. Thanks
	  to Alexey Torkhov for the bug report.

   2008-03-10 08:52  mmakaay
	* Fixed #717: User data doesn't get reloaded after profile edit.
	  Thanks to Alexey Torkhov for the bug report.

   2008-03-09 19:14  mmakaay
	* Fix for #716: Typo in the forums API code.

   2008-03-08 20:18  mmakaay
	* Fix for #715: Warning spamhurdles/settings.php:106: "Undefined
	  variable: warn"

   2008-03-08 20:15  mmakaay
	* Fix for #714: SQL error "Column 'user_id' in where clause is
	  ambiguous" in the Event Logging module, when filtering by user_id.

   2008-03-04 11:45  mmakaay
	* Fix for #709": PHP warning for undefined index "thread" in event
	  logging module (thanks to Alexey Torkhov)

   2008-03-03 21:35  mmakaay
	* Fix for #708: Dates in the admin interface were not shown in a
	  consistent way, because sometimes hard-coded date formats were
	  used.

   2008-03-03 03:50  mmakaay
	* Fix for #650: Make [url=mailto:...]...[/url] work in the bbcode
	  module

   2008-03-03 03:37  mmakaay
	* Fix for #704: phorum_relative_date() doesn't honor the timezone
	  settings

   2008-03-03 01:25  mmakaay
	* The Image API thumbnail code now generates JPEG thumbnails instead
	  of PNG. JPEG allows for better compression, resulting in smaller
	  images. When using PNG, the thumbnails are sometimes bigger in
	  filesize than the original images.

   2008-03-03 00:46  mmakaay
	* New hooks for the private message system: buddy_list, pm_list,
	  pm_read.

   2008-03-02 19:26  mmakaay
	* Fixed #706: Editor Tools module doesn't use constants for default
	  icon size. Thanks to Alexey Torkhov for the bug report.

   2008-03-02 19:20  mmakaay
	* Automatic processing of bare URLs and email addresses is made
	  optional through two new BBcode module settings (ticket #696,
	  thanks for the suggestion Alexey Torkhov).

   2008-03-02 17:29  mmakaay
	* Fixed #690: Harmless warnings from file cache layer should now be
	  suppressed.

   2008-02-29 14:35  mmakaay
	* Fixed a bug in the username restrictions module. It was not
	  possible to set a minimum length in combination with no maximum
	  length. The maximum length was set to the minimum length in this
	  case. Thanks to Lammi41 for the bug report and the patch.

   2008-02-28 14:30  mmakaay
	* Implemented a hook call "page_<phorum_page>" that can be used to
	  run a "common" hook for specific pages only (e.g. "page_index",
	  "page_pm", etc.)

   2008-02-25 12:16  ts77
	* fixed double escaping of the excerpt in search results

   2008-02-24 19:18  ts77
	* applied change from [2827] to atom feed and fixing double escaping
	  of subject (fixing #686, thanks to Alexey Torkhov)

   2008-02-19 11:57  mmakaay
	* Fixed #692: the control center and private message pages no longer
	  show the forum descriptions (thanks to James Revillini for the bug
	  report). Additionally, the heading for the private messages pages
	  was set to a better value.

   2008-02-19 08:53  mmakaay
	* Added a comments field to the banlist items, based on a patch that
	  was provided by James Revillini. Thanks James!

   2008-02-18 13:06  ts77
	* added options for port and socket to database configuration and
	  the appropriate layers and documentation (#683, thanks to Alexey
	  Torkhov)

   2008-02-18 11:46  ts77
	* fixed layout for pm_list_incoming.tpl, (#699, thanks to Alexey
	  Torkhov)

   2008-02-17 14:04  ts77
	* added page argument to print view link so that it shows the page
	  you are at in print view (fixing #695, thanks to Alexey Torkhov)

   2008-02-16 17:07  ts77
	* only allow template selection through url if not set to fixed view
	  (fixing #693, thanks to Alexey Torkhov)

   2008-02-16 16:50  ts77
	* added format_fixup hook to announcements module too (fixing #694,
	  thanks to Alexey Torkhov)

   2008-02-11 22:23  mmakaay
	* Added a fix for making the database install code work for the Spam
	  Hurdles module work in MySQL strict mode. Thanks to phorum.org
	  user "shaneshack" for finding and reporting the problem!

   2008-02-09 23:28  mmakaay
	* Fixed #688: Changed {URL->MARKREAD} to {URL->MARK_READ} in the
	  classic template (thanks to Alexey Torkov).

   2008-02-06 01:18  mmakaay
	* Fixed the subject bad word censoring checks. The checks were run,
	  but the outcome was stored in the wrong variable.

   2008-02-05 19:37  mmakaay
	* Fix for the database layer to correctly process MySQL error code
	  1582, which was temporarily implemented in the MySQL server
	  (versions 5.1.15 up to 5.1.20). This error code has been reverted
	  to the original error code 1062 in the fix for MySQL bug report
	  #28842. Unfortunately we have to add this work around to Phorum
	  for this now. References: -
	  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-20.html -
	  http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=28842

   2008-01-25 17:37  brian
	* Added the direct link to the message for each message in flat and
	  hybrid view for easy copy and paste.

   2008-01-18 12:31  mmakaay
	* Fix for #675: Wrong variable use for "place it in ...." text.

   2008-01-18 12:28  mmakaay
	* Fix for #675: "Post" and "SaveChanges" not recognized by language
	  admin tool.

   2008-01-18 12:11  mmakaay
	* Change "onchange" event for "Follow topic" checkbox to "onclick"
	  to work around a problem with MSIE7 not visibly acting on checkbox
	  changes (event bubbling seems to be halted for "onchange" in
	  MSIE7, thanks MS!)

   2008-01-18 11:20  mmakaay
	* Fixed a bug that was reported by charliemc86: enabling the option
	  "Ignore Admin for moderator-emails" had no effect. Administrators
	  would still get moderation email messages. Thanks Charlie!

   2008-01-07 21:28  ts77
	* MFH: fixed possible sql-injection in non-fulltext search (not
	  enabled by default)

   2007-12-30 11:07  ts77
	* made breadcrumbs urls default to index-url instead of list and
	  added option for rebuilding forum-paths to the admin (thanks to
	  Berti)

   2007-12-24 13:26  mmakaay
	* Fix for #640: Suppress some more possible error messages from file
	  cache layer.

   2007-12-24 11:21  mmakaay
	* Fix for #634: Descriptions in the header were HTML stripped, but
	  that is only needed for the meta description. A new template
	  variable {HTML_DESCRIPTION} was introduced, which contains the
	  unstripped version of the description.

   2007-12-24 10:43  ts77
	* adding parameter to avoid populating the search table (e.g. in
	  case an alternate backend is used), thanks jefft, closing #667

   2007-12-24 10:31  mmakaay
	* Fix for #649: An empty feed is now provided if no forums are
	  readable. # In 5.2, an empty valid feed was already provided if
	  there were no messages # in a forum, but an empty document was
	  returned if no forums were readable. # Since the recent messages
	  code does handle permission checking, we can # safely remove the
	  read permission checks from the start of the feed.php code.

   2007-12-24 09:55  mmakaay
	* Fixed #669: Strip illegal ASCII control characters from XML feed.

   2007-12-15 17:39  ts77
	* breadcrumbs in template are now generated from the forum-path
	  stored and not hacked together

   2007-12-15 16:24  ts77
	* fixed classic-template search

   2007-12-14 11:01  mmakaay
	* Implemented a template define {DEFINE tidy_template <value>}. This
	  variable determines whether tidying has to be done on the compiled
	  template code. The <value> can be one of: 0 - Apply no compression
	  at all. 1 - Remove leading and trailing white space and fully
	  delete empty lines. 2 - Additionally, remove some extra unneeded
	  white space and HTML comments. # This option is implemented as a
	  template setting and not as a global # configuration setting, to
	  prevent broken templates if for some reason # the tidying process
	  cripples the template code. This way, the settings # can be
	  different per template.

   2007-12-12 23:14  mmakaay
	* Added an option "Disable automatic displaying of the
	  announcements?" to the announcement module. With that option
	  enabled, the admin can determine for himself at what exact spot in
	  the templates the announcements are visible by adding the
	  {MOD_ANNOUNCEMENTS} template code to them.

   2007-12-11 19:08  ts77
	* fixed attachments in read_threads.tpl (fixing #663, thx to
	  stevehealy)

   2007-12-08 13:57  mmakaay
	* MFT: # Some small fixes for correctly falling back to the default
	  template.

   2007-12-06 11:12  ts77
	* added charset definition to create-table statements and
	  connections

   2007-11-30 00:08  mmakaay
	* MFH # Documentation navigation for phorum.org online
	  documentation.

   2007-11-25 17:46  mmakaay
	* MFT: # Make floating objects in a quote work correctly. Also only
	  style the MFT: # direct child of a bbcode quote div, so divs
	  within quote aren't mangled.

   2007-11-17 11:54  ts77
	* localized smileys-help button (fixing #655, thx Regdos)

   2007-11-02 16:28  mmakaay
	* Fixed css code.

   2007-11-02 12:36  mmakaay
	* Modules can now register for adding additional CSS code to the
	  base Phorum CSS code using the module system. This way, we can
	  prevent the need to either add additional <link>s for CSS to the
	  pages (more file downloads per page) or add additional CSS code to
	  the <head> section of the pages (more data to download per page).
	  The resulting CSS code is cached and the last modified
	  functionality is used to not let browsers download the CSS code if
	  nothing changed.

   2007-10-29 04:35  brian
	* fixed mod_tidy to not step on pre and xmp tags

   2007-10-28 22:30  mmakaay
	* Implemented multiple RSS links in the page headers, to provide RSS
	  links for both feeds containing topics and feeds containing topics
	  + replies.

   2007-10-22 17:02  mmakaay
	* Added Turkish language file.

   2007-10-19 17:13  ts77
	* added first shot of a master/slave layer (experimental)

   2007-10-11 21:48  mmakaay
	* Speed improvements for phorum_db_get_recent_messages().

   2007-10-08 15:15  mmakaay
	* Added a new forum option "Count views per thread for non-threaded
	  list views". This feature can be used to keep track of a global
	  view counter for each thread. If enabled, the flat message list
	  view will show that global thread view counter instead of the view
	  counter for the first message of the thread. Note that this
	  requires an extra database update for each view, so you might now
	  want to enable this on very busy forums.

   2007-09-25 23:27  mmakaay
	* Improved handling of followed threads in case email notification
	  is disallowed for a forum.

   2007-09-25 21:00  mmakaay
	* Reduce redir time.

   2007-09-25 20:51  mmakaay
	* Fixes.

   2007-09-20 14:07  mmakaay
	* Fixes #640: @ in front of rmdir/unlink to prevent warnings on race
	  conditions.

   2007-09-15 23:39  mmakaay
	* Fixed a local file inclusion security hole as reported by
	  kernelnewbies.org. Also went over the full code and added strict
	  inclusion prevention code for all include statements.

   2007-09-13 09:15  mmakaay
	* Partly fixed #625: "Undefined offset: 1" warnings should no longer
	  occur now.

   2007-09-12 07:40  mmakaay
	* Fixed #626: undefined index warning in versioncheck.php

   2007-09-10 23:49  brian
	* Working solution for faster new indicators and counts on index.
	  Includes new moved field in messages table instead of old methods
	  for marking move notices.

   2007-09-08 12:48  mmakaay
	* Fix for #602 : make displaying of newflags conditional

   2007-09-03 14:29  mmakaay
	* Implemented a new hook "cc_panel", which can be used to build
	  extra cc panels from a module, without having to copy script files
	  into the Phorum tree. This one goes along nicely with the
	  tpl_cc_menu_options_hook and tpl_cc_menu_moderator_hook hooks.

   2007-08-23 09:01  mmakaay
	* Fixed #618: recovering password didn't work: used a deprecated
	  function call

   2007-08-18 12:31  ts77
	* removed meta-description in search-pages (#616)

   2007-08-18 12:28  ts77
	* fixing phorum_check_read_common for global handling of OKMSG
	  (#613)

   2007-08-18 12:24  ts77
	* fixed the bbcode feature-names so that they can be really enabled
	  (#614)

   2007-08-17 12:36  mmakaay
	* Implemented new CAPTCHA type: reCAPTCHA
	  (http://www.recaptcha.net/). # Checking of the captcha answer is
	  now done from the captcha objects # (new method check_answer()).
	  Before, we had a generic piece of code # in the spamhurdles.php
	  module script. This is done to be able to # implement the
	  non-standard answer check that is needed for reCAPTCHA.

   2007-08-10 04:02  brian
	* fixed notice about $_POST["username"]

   2007-08-09 07:00  mmakaay
	* Fixed problem with losing the forum_id when searching.

   2007-08-05 04:49  brian
	* Added new option for a new message indicator on index page. Its
	  much faster than new counts

   2007-08-04 18:37  brian
	* New hook after_message_save

   2007-07-26 18:07  ts77
	* take "Allow Template Selection" into account while choosing the
	  template to use (fixing #603)

   2007-07-21 21:08  brian
	* Fixed IE issue in ticket #594

   2007-07-21 21:03  brian
	* Fix for ticket #591

   2007-07-21 20:58  brian
	* Fix for ticket #597

   2007-07-21 20:50  brian
	* adding start of lightweight template

   2007-07-21 20:49  brian
	* adding start of lightweight template

   2007-07-16 11:16  ts77
	* moved to swiftmailer for mail-sending by SMTP also through
	  SSL/TLS. Requirement is PHP5 now.

   2007-07-16 11:10  mmakaay
	* Allow for email notification enabled as default install option.

   2007-07-13 20:46  ts77
	* added option to mark-thread-read from list (through patch from
	  Mathias in #579)

   2007-07-10 17:44  mmakaay
	* Fix for #583: pointy brackets were accidentally added twice in the
	  msgid header

   2007-07-10 02:02  brian
	* New, faster phorum_get_url function and URL fixes

   2007-07-09 23:51  brian
	* fixed sorting threads with missing nodes

   2007-07-07 20:38  mmakaay
	* Fix for #580: $PHORUM['SETTINGS'] is filled but (almost) not used
	  in the core. We removed references to $PHORUM['SETTINGS'] and do
	  not fill it anymore from the database layer.

   2007-07-07 19:33  ts77
	* added asking for original password on changing password in
	  controlcenter (by patch from Edward Z. Yang in #576)

   2007-07-07 16:37  brian
	* Added announcement conversion script for 5.2

   2007-07-06 22:22  mmakaay
	* Improved switching between user selected templates. The new
	  template is now displayed immediately. Also fixed a bug with
	  handling of user templates that are set to no longer existaning
	  templates (Phorum would fall back to the default template, but
	  things like images and other items depending on the template name
	  would point to the user template name).

   2007-07-06 10:59  mmakaay
	* Made a large sweep through the code to add a charset to all
	  appropriate htmlspecialchars() calls in the code. They now all
	  make use of a new language file variable
	  $PHORUM['DATA']['HCHARSET']. This one can be set different from
	  the CHARSET, to prevent spawning of PHP warnings, because of
	  unsupported character sets. If HCHARSET is empty, then Phorum will
	  automatically use the standard CHARSET for htmlspecialchars().

   2007-07-03 09:13  ts77
	* only invalidate newflag cache if there were really new read
	  messages (fixing #578, reported and patch by Mathias)

   2007-07-01 12:08  mmakaay
	* Fixed phorum.org link in the doc navigation.

   2007-06-30 20:41  mmakaay
	* Fixed #572, reported by Edward Z. Yang.

   2007-06-30 20:30  mmakaay
	* Fixed #572, reported by Edward Z. Yang.

   2007-06-30 20:25  mmakaay
	* Fixed #571 (bug for cache sanity check on win2000), reported by
	  Edward Z. Yang.

   2007-06-30 20:09  mmakaay
	* Fixed #564 (reported by Edward Z. Yang) and a couple of other
	  similar bugs.

   2007-06-20 21:27  ts77
	* adapting email-notify defaults to new posting form

   2007-06-14 22:23  mmakaay
	* In the admin general settings, there's a new option "Put file name
	  in pathinfo for file download URLs". If this option is enabled
	  (disabled by default), then pathinfo will be added to file
	  download URLs, to trick browser into using the correct filename
	  when downloading Phorum files through file.php (normally, "Save as
	  ..." would result in the default save file name "file.php"). Note:
	  this feature requires a webserver which understands pathinfo in
	  the URLs. Most webservers do as far as I know.

   2007-06-08 06:40  brian
	* Modules can be enabled at install time now

   2007-06-08 05:38  brian
	* Added end_output hook, documented start_output and end_output and
	  added mod_tidy that uses those hooks

   2007-06-07 13:53  ts77
	* added global option to hide email-addresses (#559)

   2007-06-04 23:06  mmakaay
	* No longer in use.

   2007-05-28 13:06  mmakaay
	* Fix for #558: on posting and editing messages, the form now
	  contains a "Follow thread" checkbox. If that box is checked, then
	  a related checkbox is shown for "Email me about replies to this
	  topic". This way, the user has full control on how to follow
	  thread at post time and follow options do no longer get lost
	  sometimes when editing messages.

   2007-05-27 09:54  mmakaay
	* PM user not found message is now fixed correctly.

   2007-05-27 09:16  mmakaay
	* Fixed a XSS bug in the user moderation script.

   2007-05-26 20:25  brian
	* Moved all template output to common function for control. Added
	  new start_output hook

   2007-05-26 19:39  brian
	* must shorten author part of key for UTF8 users

   2007-05-26 18:47  brian
	* Added shutdown function for future use and a shutdown hook

   2007-05-24 19:23  mmakaay
	* Oops... INTs should have had a zero default,

   2007-05-21 16:55  ts77
	* added a new sanity check for module filenames. fixing #416

   2007-05-15 21:36  mmakaay
	* Made the phorum_hook calls conditional, which should speed up
	  execution time for system that do not use the hooks. Here's a
	  quick benchmark between 1000 conditional and unconditional calls:
	  conditional: 0.0022 sec, unconditional: 0.1079 sec. This probably
	  won't cause a drastic speed improvement, but it's an easy way to
	  speed up execution time for hooks that are not in use by any
	  module.

   2007-05-14 09:43  mmakaay
	* Cleaned up the timing code from the thread sorting code.

   2007-05-08 21:50  ts77
	* added hook for modifying default search settings

   2007-05-08 00:36  mmakaay
	* First version of a Phorum C extension for speeding up tasks by
	  means of pure C-code. The extension should never be mandatory. It
	  should only provide fast and light weight alternatives for the
	  pure PHP-code solutions. # The first function that is targeted by
	  this module is # tree sorting. This isn't fully finished yet, but
	  the basic # sorting algorithm is working by reordering a message
	  array # in place.

   2007-05-05 11:27  mmakaay
	* Added the "Show in user admin" option to the custom profile field
	  admin screen and wrote some additional help for that screen.

   2007-05-05 10:55  mmakaay
	* Moved real_name from a custom profile field to a real user table
	  field. # Note: we have to be aware of XSS issues with this one,
	  because it was an # auto-escaped profile field. But I think I
	  found all (core) occurrances # in which this might be an issue.

   2007-05-04 22:36  mmakaay
	* Created a custom profile field API. Updated the admin custom
	  profile fields script to make use of this API. Also implemented a
	  new way of deleting custom fields. If an admin accidentally
	  deleted a field, then he can create a new field with the same
	  name, which will give him the choice of restoring the deleted
	  field or creating a fully new field. The rest of Phorum has to be
	  investigated to see where the new delete system has impact (a
	  couple of changes are probably needed).

   2007-05-04 17:22  brian
	* Fixed bug #547

   2007-05-02 15:22  mmakaay
	* Announcements module is in Phorum trunk

   2007-05-02 11:37  mmakaay
	* Fixed search bug: when selecting specific forums to search: Fatal
	  error: [] operator not supported for strings in search.php on line
	  61.

   2007-05-01 13:18  mmakaay
	* Moved the new database layer code to be the primary database
	  layer. The mysql.php layer now automatically detects the mysql PHP
	  extension to use. The config.php can be used to override the
	  automatic detection mechanism.

   2007-05-01 01:59  mmakaay
	* Ported the new search code over to the new db layer and fixed a
	  couple of bugs in the code.

   2007-04-30 19:05  mmakaay
	* Created a file storage layer API, which handles storing files
	  (personal files for users and attachments for messages). This
	  layer should make it very easy to implement different file storage
	  systems by means of a module. This layer is still work in
	  progress. There are probably a few more file related functions
	  that can go in this file storage API. I also started on an idea
	  for providing a real Phorum API, by moving generic code from the
	  front end scripts to API libraries. The goal that I have in mind
	  for this is to make it possible to add additional API's (like Ajax
	  and SOAP) to Phorum, without having to write API code that copies
	  loads and loads of the core code from the front end scripts. A
	  structured and documented API for Phorum should also provide
	  better and stable support for module writers. The API code can be
	  found in include/api/*.

   2007-04-27 23:28  ts77
	* added banlist-caching

   2007-04-27 01:58  ts77
	* added minimum required version for modules (closing #521)

   2007-04-27 00:53  brian
	* Added edit tracking and ability to show changes to a message over
	  time

   2007-04-26 21:45  ts77
	* added changes for printview closing #153

   2007-04-26 15:45  mmakaay
	* A stress test script, which can be used to add lots of users and
	  messages to the database for mass testing. This is a developer
	  tool only.

   2007-04-26 07:13  brian
	* Rewrote search engine. Added forum selection, ability to search
	  for authors and keywords in one search and showing results as
	  threads or messages

   2007-04-25 22:18  ts77
	* added possibility to delete multiple/all messages at once in the
	  unapproved messages panel

   2007-04-25 07:28  brian
	* Fixing #540

   2007-04-25 07:00  ts77
	* added building the forum-path in the admin ("fixing" #213)

   2007-04-25 05:40  brian
	* Fixed #412

   2007-04-25 05:35  brian
	* Fully implemented read only mode

   2007-04-25 00:17  brian
	* Added required cookie mode

   2007-04-24 22:33  brian
	* Fixed feed.php issues in ticket #422

   2007-04-24 21:23  brian
	* Added connection handle to mysql_error. Ticket #542

   2007-04-15 11:11  mmakaay
	* Implemented a new hook: failed_login. This hook can be used for
	  tracking failed login attempts.

   2007-04-13 11:18  mmakaay
	* Fix for #500: Get rid of die() statements, in favor of
	  trigger_error().

   2007-04-13 10:40  mmakaay
	* Fix for #531: PM preview did not show message formatting.

   2007-04-11 15:08  mmakaay
	* Allow for a button container in the template with id=editor-tools

   2007-04-11 09:41  ts77
	* "MFB: # initializing maildata-arr"

   2007-04-10 20:44  mmakaay
	* Fixed the phorum_db_sanitize_mixed() function to work correctly
	  with PHP4.

   2007-04-10 19:21  brian
	* Fixed minor issue using get methods to delete items in admin.
	  Found by Janek Vind (waraxe)

   2007-04-10 18:34  brian
	* Fix for Opera javascript redirect issue and response splitting in
	  IE for old versions of PHP

   2007-04-07 01:24  mmakaay
	* Typo fixed

   2007-04-07 00:54  mmakaay
	* New MySQL database layer. The main difference with the existing
	  database layers is that in this layer the real database
	  interaction functionality is limited to a single function. Porting
	  the layer to other databases should be less work due to these
	  changes. # Note: there are a couple of TODO: remarks in the code
	  with some ideas # and things to look at. We should also look if we
	  can bring the used # SQL as much as possible to ANSI SQL (unless
	  performance would suffer # of course).

   2007-04-06 11:47  ts77
	* "MFB: adding htmlspecialchars to hidden fields in the admin to fix
	  some XSS-issues in the admin reported by Janek Vind 'waraxe'"

   2007-04-05 15:28  ts77
	* "MFB: fixed path disclosure in admin. Reported by Janek Vind
	  'waraxe'"

   2007-04-05 15:25  ts77
	* "MFB: fixed priviledge escalation for moderators. Reported by
	  Janek Vind 'waraxe'"

   2007-03-28 19:59  brian
	* Fixed password changing issue reported in chat

   2007-03-26 23:23  brian
	* Fixed sql injection that could expose user data. Reported by Janek
	  Vind 'waraxe'

   2007-03-22 10:40  mmakaay
	* Some extra safety in the metaquery code

   2007-03-21 02:33  mmakaay
	* Added option for an IS (NOT) NULL query in the metaquery code

   2007-03-19 03:45  brian
	* Updated markdown module to do its own quoting per ticket #530

   2007-03-17 13:14  mmakaay
	* Implemented a new upgrade system, which makes use of two versions
	  internally. One for the main database schema version and one for
	  the database schema patch level. This system solves some problems
	  that we have with the current upgrade system in case we are doing
	  upgrade to both a stable and a development version of Phorum. See
	  also phorum.org's development Wiki for more info on the design of
	  the new upgrade system. I also put the table upgrade function
	  inside include/version_functions.php, so both the console and the
	  web upgrade scripts can make use of it. The console script was
	  also updated to request user input for performing upgrade actions.
	  This is similar to the way in which the web interface works now.
	  This is especially good in case there are errors. # Important note
	  for upcoming db upgrades: # Mind that for 5.2, the system will be
	  more or less up-side-down in use, to # be able to get it
	  bootstrapped in conjunction with 5.1. There can still # be
	  database upgrades for 5.1. These can be put in the 5.1 tree in the
	  same # way as we always did. We also put them in the standard
	  schema upgrade tree # for 5.2. This way, the two trees can fully
	  match and there's no problem # in upgrading between the versions.
	  Changes which only go in 5.2 though, # are not allowed in the
	  schema upgrades! These have to be put in the 5.2 # patch upgrade
	  tree instead, so they won't collide with the standard upgrades. #
	  Because 5.1 does not contain patches, all these 5.2 patches will
	  be run # when upgrading to this version. # # After 5.2 goes stable
	  and we start with 5.3 development, we can fully # follow the rules
	  for the new schema/patch upgrade system. # # Note: # Within the
	  rules of the upgrade system it is fine to always run all # patch
	  level upgrades prior to the schema upgrades (because patches imply
	  # that older versions of Phorum are patched too, which means that
	  all # the patches should be able to run on the last schema upgrade
	  version for # the oldest patched version of Phorum. We have to
	  beware that with the # above up-side-down system, this might not
	  be the case. If we ever write # a 5.1/5.2 schema upgrade which
	  should be executed before a 5.2 patch # to work, then we have to
	  change the logic of the upgrade system. It then # has to collect
	  all patches + schema upgrades and sort them, so all # changes are
	  run in upgrade version order. I don't suspect this will be # the
	  issue though, since no large database upgrades are to be expected
	  # for 5.1 anymore. # # Fixing the internal version: # This patch
	  also reverts the internal version of 5022006090700, which was #
	  set to this value as a different attempt to fix the difficulties.
	  For 5.2 # systems that already run this internal version, the
	  following query will # bring the system back in line (mind to use
	  the correct table prefix): # UPDATE phorum_settings SET
	  data='2007010000' WHERE name ='internal_version'; # This will
	  trigger a db upgrade and after that followup upgrades must be #
	  picked up again. # # How to test the upgrade system: # If you want
	  to test the patch/schema upgrade system with the currently #
	  available upgrades, then it's safe to run the above query, plus
	  the following # one to bring the system into a patch + schema
	  upgrade state: # DELETE FROM phorum_settings WHERE name =
	  'internal_patchlevel';

   2007-03-14 10:45  mmakaay

   2007-03-05 11:27  mmakaay
	* Added an extra option to the offsite linking permissions, which
	  allows for linking uploaded files from the same web site. The
	  admin can now choose from "Only from the forum", "From this web
	  site" and "From any web site".

   2007-02-23 02:15  mmakaay
	* Fixed a bbcode quote tag bug (#524).

	* rebuild panel for rebuilding forum-stats and meta-data (closing
	  #488)

   2006-10-09 15:58  mmakaay
	* Added a system checking step to the installation, which runs the
	  sanity checks. Sanity checks now get an extra parameter, which
	  tells if they are being run from the install script. Checks which
	  do not have to be run at all at install time, can now return
	  PHORUM_SANITY_SKIP. Doing so will keep them from being displayed
	  in the checks overview. The installation will not continue as long
	  as there are critical errors. The admin can choose to ignore
	  warnings and continue installing.

   2006-10-02 20:16  mmakaay
	* Added sanity check for checking if all important Phorum files are
	  available

   2006-10-02 15:07  ts77

	* The followed threads in the control center display newflags too
	  now

   2006-09-06 11:59  ts77
	* "MFB: # don't set the forum-id on adding a new forum"

	* addon.php allows for addon scripts that are implemented using a
	  module

   2006-08-21 22:32  mmakaay
	* New feature for supporting a templates directory inside a module
	  directory. By specifying a template name as <module>::<page>, the
	  template system will look for the template file in the following
	  path: ./mods/<module>/templates/<template>/<page>.tpl (or
	  <page>.php)

   2006-08-16 19:55  ts77
	* added option to show selected custom fields in the user-admin

	* Implementation of module / hook priorities, which can be used to
	  change the order in which module hooks are run. Extra statements
	  can be put in the module info now. Possible statements are: -
	  priority: load module before|after * - priority: load module
	  before|after <othermodule> - priority: run hook <hookname>
	  before|after * - priority: run hook <hookname> before|after
	  <othermodule> When sorting modules and hooks, the priorities are
	  processed in this order.

   2006-07-06 15:29  brian

   2006-04-09 10:51  mmakaay
	* {include ..} has been changed and {include_var ..} has been
	  deprecated. {include ..} can now take both variables and page
	  names, by using {include "page"} and {include VARIABLE}. So that
	  last on replaces include_var.

	  5.2

   2006-04-07 21:55  mmakaay
	* {var ..} and {assign ..} are now identical. Both take the new
	  value format. The format of the value to assign can be numerical
	  (1), string ("my string"), php definition (mydefine) and other
	  template variables (USER->username).

   2006-04-07 09:59  mmakaay
	* New template processing code which uses a two-pass processing
	  method. In pass one, all {include ..} statements are resolved, so
	  at the end of this pass, we have a full single template. In pass
	  two, all other template statements are converted to PHP code. This
	  was done to work around some problems with template files that are
	  included inside loop statements (determining the use of the DATA
	  or TMP index failed there). Also, some more documentation was
	  added to the code.

   2006-04-07 09:49  mmakaay
	* Added a new function: phorum_get_template_file(), which is used
	  for retrieving input and output filenames for a given template
	  name. Changed phorum_get_template() to use
	  phorum_get_template_file() and a new version of
	  include/templates.php.

   2006-03-22 12:01  mmakaay

   2006-02-08 16:32  mmakaay
	* Made the notification message for PM faster, by using
	  phorum_db_pm_checknew(). Beware that this change inflicts a
	  template change. Instead of the variable {PRIVATE_MESSAGES->new},
	  the variable {NEW_PRIVATE_MESSAGES} has to be used. Before,
	  {PRIVATE_MESSAGES->new} contained the number of new messages,
	  while now {NEW_PRIVATE_MESSAGES} contains a value that indicated
	  whether there are new messages or not.

   2006-02-08 16:29  mmakaay
	* Added function phorum_db_pm_checknew for quick checking for new
	  PMs to db layers

   2006-02-08 16:05  mmakaay
	* Some optimization in the private message formatting code for more

	  hard-coded smiley path "./smileys" was used instead # of the
	  configurable prefix. # * Fixed showing a smiley preview image. # *
	  Preview image is now also shown directly when starting to edit a
	  smiley. # * Implemented a separate mods/smileys/defaults.php file,
	  for easy # default config value maintenance and initial
	  configuration setup. # * In the $PHORUM["mod_smileys"] array,
	  smileys are not stored at the same # level as the other settings
	  anymore. # * The smiley prefix path is better checked for
	  problems. # * The smiley prefix path is forced to always have an
	  ending "/" character. # * Only files with a real image extension
	  are used in the smiley drop down. # * If configured smileys have
	  an unavailable image, the "Smiley image" # column in the overview
	  will say "UNAVAILABLE" and a clear warning message # is shown to
	  the administrator, telling him to fix the problem(s). # * The
	  smiley body & subject replacement arrays are cached in the
	  database. # * The message "no smileys configured" was never shown.
	  # * Inputs for smiley and alt tag are made smaller (50 was too
	  much IMO). # * Smiley images are put in the CSS class
	  "phorum-smiley", so users can # style the image if they want to. #
	  * Installation of a default list of smileys is taken out of #
	  include/db/mysql.php. This is now fully handled by the module
	  itself. # * Description for "thumbs up smiley" changed to "the
	  finger smiley". # * Smileys are now stored inside the module
	  directory itself. # * The configuration for the old smileys mod is
	  automatically converted.

   2005-10-10 13:59  mmakaay
	* New template feature: {HOOK hook_name arg1 arg2 .. argn} # Hooks
	  can now also be called in templates. This is solely for # being
	  able to let modules writers extend the forms that Phorum uses. #
	  If one hook argument is used, the hook code will translate to: #
	  phorum_hook(hook_name, arg1) # If multiple hook arguments are
	  used, it will translate to: # phorum_hook(hook_name, array(arg1,
	  arg2, .., argn)) # The hook may also be called without using
	  arguments.

   2005-10-08 05:01  brian

   2005-10-06 23:21  mmakaay

   2005-10-06 05:00  brian
	* simplified the help pop up by ridding us of the iframe and the

	* Implemented a buddy system for private messaging.

   2005-10-01 22:24  mmakaay
	* Added a new option "System Sanity Checks" to the admin panel. This
	  can be used to run a number of checks on the system to see if it
	  is configured correctly for using Phorum. # Implementation: # #
	  All checks are stored as single PHP files in the directory #
	  include/admin/sanity_checks/ # Each file you create there must at
	  least have the following: # # * A variable $check_description
	  which is set to the description # string that is showed in the
	  sanity checks result screen. # * A function named
	  phorum_check_<file basename> which does the # actual checking.
	  This function has to return two parameters. # The first one is one
	  of the constants PHORUM_SANITY_OK, # PHORUM_SANITY_WARN or
	  PHORUM_SANITY_CRIT. The second one # is a description of a problem
	  that was found or NULL in # case no problem was found. # # The
	  sanity checking frontend will then take care of the rest. # #
	  Already implemented checks are checks for: # - database connection
	  (Config available and can we connect?) # - cache directory (Can we
	  find and write there? And does caching work?) # - file uploading
	  (Checking PHP/MySQL max upload size against settings)

   2005-09-28 10:51  mmakaay
	* Fixed #123: when deleting a thread, also delete move notification

	  just one large template is processed on output (see #90 for
	  details)

   2005-09-16 13:39  mmakaay
	* Implemented a whole new backend for the PM system. This backend is
	  a preparation for a more sophisticated PM system which supports
	  things like user folders, buddy lists, multiple recipients and a
	  trash bin. # # Notes: # # Because the way messages are stored has
	  changed, the old PM calls # from mysql.php have been deprecated.
	  When calling these functions, # an error message will be shown.
	  This will only be done in case # non-Phorum scripts call the old
	  functions. Phorum uses the new API. # # In the database migration
	  script, dropping the old private messages # table is not yet
	  included, so in case of problems a rollback is # possible without
	  loosing the old private messages. This will be # incorporated as
	  soon as the new code has proven to be stable. # # New database
	  structure: # # {prefix}_pm_messages: holds the message data for a
	  PM # {prefix}_pm_folders: holds the custom folders for the users #
	  {prefix}_pm_xref: links users, messages and folders together # #
	  The inbox and outbox for the users are built-in special folders, #
	  so there will not be in {prefix}_pm_folders.

   2005-09-13 11:15  mmakaay
	* Added configuration option for setting max nr. of messages in the
	  PM storage of a user

   2005-09-12 23:01  mmakaay

	  array_shift(some_function()) are no longer accepted.

	* Fixed some more line-ending properties

   2005-08-29 00:17  mmakaay
	* Disabled cumulative attachment size check in case no config value
	  is set

   2005-08-28 23:52  mmakaay
	* Added max cumulative size to attachment settings and some fixes: *
	  max cumulative size is used to be able to set a maximum total size
	  for all attachments together. So now you can allow for example 10
	  attachments of each 1 Mb max, but limit the total attachment size
	  to 2 Mb. So the user can upload for example either 10 photo's or 1
	  MP3 file, but not 10 MP3 files. * uploading one or more
	  attachments always replaced the complete list of attachments,
	  instead of adding attachments to it; * Added some more explanation
	  for the attachment admin parameters, to make clear what an empty
	  or zero value means to Phorum; * The list of allowed file types is
	  not shown anymore in the template case no list is set in the admin
	  interface (so you won't get "You are allowed to attach files of
	  the following type:" without any options behind it on screen);

   2005-08-28 18:49  mmakaay
	* Updates from #106
