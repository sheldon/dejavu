      Why do I always end up at the top of a page when using the back button?
    </title>
    <para>
      Your PHP setup is probably sending headers along with the reply, telling
      the browser to not cache the page. Therefore, when going to the previous
      page, it will be reloaded as if it were a new page. You can tweak the
      PHP settings to not have PHP sending these headers. Edit the php.ini and
      set the "session.cache_limiter" directive to have no value at all. So
      the line in php.ini would end up like this:
      <programlisting>
        session.cache_limiter =
      </programlisting>
      After editing the php.ini, restart the webserver. From then on, using
      the back button should work like expected.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you do not have access to php.ini (you are using a hosting account),
      submit a request to your host asking that they change the
      aforementioned parameter for you. Most hosts should be willing to do
      this in the majority of cases.

    <title>Help! I've deleted the admin user and can't log in!</title>
    <para>
      Create a new user using the registration form, and then set
      the admin parameter of the user to 1 in the database itself.
      This can be done using phpmyAdmin or a similar control panel,
      or the shell.

    <title>Why do I get a database error about temporary tables when I search?</title>
    <para>
      If you get an access denied error about CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE when
      you search, the MySQL user assigned to your Phorum database does not
      have the rights to create temporary tables, which the search feature
      uses. To fix this, either grant your user temporary table creation
      permissions through a tool like phpmyadmin, or if you cannot, then
      contact your host to see if they can enable it for you.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you cannnot obtain permissions to create temporary tables, you can
      install the "Non-Temporary Search" module which you can find in our
      on line module list:<sbr/>
      <sbr/>
      &listofmodules;<sbr/>
      <sbr/>
      (warning: it will be a slow search on large data sets!)
