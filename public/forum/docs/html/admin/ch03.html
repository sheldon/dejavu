     <span class="bold"><strong> Phorum Title:</strong></span>
     Enter the title of your forum here. This will be displayed on
     the index page of your forum.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong> Phorum Description:</strong></span> A description of
     your forum. This will be displayed on the index page of your forum.
     This is also useful from a Search Engine Optimization perspective.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>DNS Lookups:</strong></span>
     If enabled, this instructs forum to perform a DNS lookup on certain
     items, such as:
     </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
         logging the hostname from which a message was posted, instead
         of the plain IP address;
       </p></li><li><p>
         being able to create IP ban items based on host and domain names;
       </p></li><li><p>
         checking the email address that is for user registrations.
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
     Generally this is a useful function for an administrator, and should
     be left enabled. However, if Phorum keeps reporting illegal email
     addresses during signup or if you are suffering from massive delays
     during posting messages, then there might be DNS problems on your
     server. In that case, disable DNS lookups as a work around.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Hide Forums:</strong></span>
     If this is enabled, forums which a user does
     not have the permissions to read will be hidden from them.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong> Show New Count in Forum List:</strong></span>
     This feature will show registered users how many new messages and
     threads there are in each forum on the forum list page. If you have
     a large number of posts, a large number of forums, a large number
     of users or some combination of the three, this setting could cause
     some performance issues. If you see performance issues, try setting
     it "No count, indicator only" or "No"
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Folder/Forum Display Style:</strong></span>
     Since version 3, Phorum has included folders.
     Until version 5.1, forums inside folders did not show until you
     clicked on the folder. In 5.1, the list of forums in a folder can
     now be shown under that folder in the forum list. This allows admins
     to organize a large list of forums all on one page.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Enable Moderator Notifications:</strong></span>
     By setting this to Yes, Phorum will display a notice to the various
     kinds of moderators when they have a new item that requires their
     attention. For example, if this setting is enabled, moderators
     will see a notice whenever there is an unapproved message.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>User Post Edit Time Limit:</strong></span>
     If set to a value larger then 0, this acts as a time limit for post
     editing. Users will only be able to edit their own posts within
     this time limit. This only applies if a user has the necessary
     permissions to edit their post, and does not affect moderators.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Track Edit Changes:</strong></span>
     When enabled, the changes made to a message will be stored
     and viewed by users. It can optionaly only be viewed by moderators.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Reply form appears:</strong></span>
     This setting specifies where the reply form for threads is
     displayed, either on the read page or on a separate page.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>After posting goto:</strong></span>
     This setting specifies where the user is redirected after
     posting, either to the message read page or the message list.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>After submitting a search query:</strong></span>
     On large forums or slow servers, searching for messages might take a
     little while. To prevent users from submitting the same search
     query over and over again (in case they think the search didn't work,
     because they didn't get their results fast enough), you can show an
     intermediate page, telling the user that the search is running.
     If your system can deliver search results quickly enough, then you can
     skip the intermediate page and go directly to the search results page.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Database error handling:</strong></span>
     This setting determines how Phorum handles database errors. The default
     is to show the errors on screen. "Errors will go to a logfile" is useful
     if you don't want your users to see the errors, and "Errors will be
     emailed" is useful if you want immediate notification of any database
     errors on your forums.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Secret private key for signing data:</strong></span>
     On several occasions, data is transferred from the Phorum system to
     the user's system and back again. To be sure that there was no
     tampering with this data on the way, it is signed by Phorum using
     this secret key. If you do not understand what this is for, then
     it is safe to simply keep the pre-configured value.
     <br>
     </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3>
       If you change this key, users who are active right now might
       experience problems.
     </div><p>
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Allow Linking to Uploaded Files:</strong></span>
     You may not want to allow other web sites to link to files that users
     have uploaded to your forums. If not, then set this option to
     "Only from the forum". If you want to use links on other parts
     of your web site, then use "From this web site". If you want to
     allow other websites to link to your forum file uploads, then select
     "From any web site".
   </p><p>
     If your needs are more specific than this (e.g. if you want to allow
     access from a specific group of web sites), you will need to use your
     web server's security features to accomplish this. Apache users can
     reference Prevent "Image Theft" at
     <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/env.html#examples" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/env.html#examples</a>.
     Users of the cPanel system can also configure this through the
     "Hotlink Protection" feature.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Put file name in pathinfo for file download URLs:</strong></span>
     All Phorum file downloads (for user files and forum message attachments)
     run through the file.php script. As a result, users who right-click a
     file URL and choose "Save link as .." will end up in their browser with
     file.php as the default file name. With this option enabled however,
     Phorum will try to give the browser a real file name instead. This is
     done by putting the file name in the URL as pathinfo (which makes the
     download link look like
     <code class="filename">/file.php/downloadfile.ext?1,2,file=3</code>).
   </p><p>
     The webserver needs to support the use of pathinfo for this feature to
     work. So if you are unable to download files after enabling this option,
     your webserver probably lacks pathinfo support and you cannot use
     this feature.
   </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Phorum PHP extension support:</strong></span>
     For very busy Phorum web sites, a special PHP extension can be installed
     for speeding up some time and memory consuming Phorum tasks. This
     extension needs to be installed in the global PHP extensions directory
     (<code class="filename">/usr/lib/php/modules</code>), so you either need to be
     the system administrator yourself or have to get help from a willing
     administrator.
   </p><p>
     The extension source can be found in the directory "extension_src" in
     the Phorum package. See the README file in that directory for
     compilation and installation instructions.
   </p><p>
     If the extension is successfully installed, then you will see a green
     square in the option line. If you see a red square, then there is no
     use in enabling this option, because Phorum was unable to detect a
     working extension in that case.
   </p><p>
   Most people can keep this option set to disabled.
   </p><p>
       <span class="bold"><strong>Phorum HTML Title:</strong></span>
       This can be used to set the title of your Phorum. Equivalent to
       changing the HTML title tag.
     </p><p>
       <span class="bold"><strong>Phorum Head Tags:</strong></span>
       This option can be used to provide additional HTML code that will
       be added to the head section of the pages. This could for example
       be used for adding meta keywords.
     </p><p>
       <span class="bold"><strong>Show and allow feed links:</strong></span>
       A feed is a standardized format for providing information about
       new content on a web site. Various programs can be used to process
       and read feed information (e.g. specialized "feed readers",
       Firefox, Google's on line feed reader, Thunderbird mail). If you
       enable this feature, then your visitors will be able to subscribe to
       feeds for your forums.
     </p><p>
       Note that feed readers will automatically poll for feed updates using
       a client side defined time interval, so with a lot of active feed
       subscriptions, the number of requests to your web server will rise.
       Phorum uses server side caching of the feed data to keep the server
       load that is required for supporting feeds to a minimum.
     </p><p>
       <span class="bold"><strong>Default feed type:</strong></span>
       There are multiple standards for providing content feeds. Phorum
       supports RSS and ATOM, which are the most widely spread XML based
       feed formats.
       <br>
       If you are unsure what to use, then select "RSS".
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>HTTP Path:</strong></span> This is the base URL of your Phorum.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Disabled URL:</strong></span> This url will be redirected to 
       when the Phorum status is disabled. If no URL is given, a message in English 
       will be displayed.
      </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Time Zone Offset:</strong></span> If you and/or your users are 
      in a different timezone than the server, you can have the default displayed time 
      adjusted by using this option.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Use Cookies:</strong></span> Phorum can track logged in users by
     using cookies or session information on URLs.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Use No Cookies:</strong></span> The session information will 
     always be included on the URL.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Allow Cookies:</strong></span> The session information will be 
     stored in cookies, if the user's browser supports it. Otherwise, the information
     is included in the URL.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Require Cookies:</strong></span> Session information is only
     stored in cookies. If the user's browser does not support cookies, the user will
     not be able to log in.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Main Session Timeout (days):</strong></span> When users log in
     to your Phorum, they are issued a cookie. You can set the timeout value to a 
     number of days that you want the cookies to stay on the users computer. If you 
     set it to 0, the cookie will only last as long as the user has the browser open.
     </p><p> 
     <span class="bold"><strong>Session Path (start with /):</strong></span>: When cookies are 
     sent to the client's browser, part of the cookies determines the path (URL) for
     which the cookies are valid. For example, if the URL is http://example.com/phorum,
     you could set the path to /phorum. Then, the user's browser would only send the 
     cookie information when the user accessed the Phorum. You could also simply / and
     the cookie info will be sent for any page on your site. This could be useful if 
     you want to use Phorum's login system for other parts of your site.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Session Domain:</strong></span> Usually you can leave this blank.
     If you know you need to use a different domain (like if you use forums.example.com, 
     you may want to just use example.com as the domain) you may enter it here.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Track User Usage:</strong></span> When set, the last time a user
     accessed the Phorum will be recorded as often as you have decided upon. This will
     require constant updates to your database. If you have a busy forum on weak
     equipment, it may be ill advised to use a short update interval.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Enable Tighter Security:</strong></span> Tight security in
     Phorum will require that users confirm their login information from time to time
     before posting messages, accessing private messages or using their Control Center.
     The length of time is determined by Short Session Timeout.
     </p><p>
     <span class="bold"><strong>Short Session Timeout:</strong></span> When tight security is 
     enabled, the users will be issued a second cookie when they type in their login
     information. If the user does not use the site for the period of time you set here,
     they will have to re-enter their login information before posting messages, 
     accessing private messages or using their Control Center. They will still be allowed
     to read the Phorum as long as their Main Session is still good. The time is in
     minutes. The minimum is 5 minutes; otherwise, your users will be very angry at 
     you. 
     <br>
     P.S. 1 day = 1440 minutes
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Allow Time Zone Selection:</strong></span> If enabled, this will
     allow users to change the timezone of the forum (specific to their account).
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Allow Template Selection:</strong></span> If enabled, users will
     find an option in their Control Center to select the template to use.
       <br>
     Note: The user selected template will only be used for forums, which do not have
     "Fixed Display Settings" enabled in the forum settings.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Registration Verification:</strong></span> This allows you to 
     force users to follow a verification process after registration. You can have
     them verify either: 
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
     by email - a link is sent to the user's email address, which they have to click
     on to activate their account)
       </p></li><li><p>
     by moderator - a moderator must approve the user before their account is activated
       </p></li></ul></div><p>
     Or both. This is a useful function to prevent spam, but keep in mind it adds extra
     hurdles for users trying to register, which could put certain people off.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Enable Drop-down user list:</strong></span> By setting this to
      Yes, Phorum will display a drop-down list of users instead of an empty text
      box on pages where you can select a user. Two examples of such pages are when 
      sending a private message, and when adding users to a group in the grou 
      moderation page. This option should be disabled if you have a large number of 
      users, as a list of thousands of users will slow performance dramatically. 
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>What to use as the display name:</strong></span> You can choose
      to use either the user's username of the real name (which can be edited by the
      user from the Control Center) as the name which the user is referenced to 
      throughout all Phorum pages.
       </p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3>
       This is not an option that you normally would want to change on a live
       system that has been running for a while. One reason is that all stored names 
       will have to be updated in the database (e.g. the posting authors), which can 
       take quite a while on a big forum (it will work though). More important is that
       you might confuse your users by changing their display names.
       </div><p>
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Hide Email Addresses:</strong></span> You can choose to set
      whether all email addresses should be hidden. This includes the email
      addresses of anonymous users and registered users in their profile. The separate
      option to hide the email address in the user Control Center will be hidden too.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>File Uploads:</strong></span> These settings apply to personal
      file uploads that users can do in their Control Center. The users can link to
      these files by copying and pasting the file URLs. Some modules (like the avatar
      module) also make user of personal files (for example, for storing images that
      the user can use as the avatar to show). Keep in mind that upload file size is
      also restricted by the upload size limit of php.ini.
        <br>
      These settings do not control uploading of forum message attachments. For 
      changing message attachment settings, you have to edit the settings of the forum
      for which you want to enable attachments.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Private Messaging (PM):</strong></span>: If enabled, this will
      allow users to access/use the private messaging system.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Check for new PM:</strong></span> By settings this to Yes, 
      Phorum will check if a user has new private messages, and display an indicator.
      On a Phorum with a lot of users and private messages, this may hurt 
      performance. This option has no effect if Private Messaging is disabled.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Maximum number of stored messages:</strong></span> This is the
      maximum number of private messages that a user may store on the server. The
      numbr of private messages is the total of all messages in all PM folders combined.
      Setting this value to 0 will allow for unlimited messages.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Allow notification of PM by email:</strong></span> If this option
     is enabled, Phorum will send a notification email to users that receive a new
     private message. The user will find an option in their Control Center which can be
     used to disable the notification email.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>System Emails from Name:</strong></span> This allows you to
      specify what name system emails are signed by.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>System Emails from Address:</strong></span> Specify which email
      address system emails are sent from.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Use Bcc in emails:</strong></span> This prevents recipients seeing 
      the complete list of recipient addresses. If this is disabled, the system will
      use CC (carbon copy), so each recipient can see all recipient email addresses.
     </p><p>
      <span class="bold"><strong>Ignore admin for moderator emails:</strong></span> If you select
      Yes for this option, then the moderator notifications and report message emails
      will not be sent to the administrator, only to moderators.
     </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="features.settings.cache"></a>3.1.2. Cache Settings</h3></div></div></div><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>Cache Directory:</strong></span> 
    Caching is used to take some load off the database and web server. The cache directory
    is used for caching preprocessed Phorum templates and for caching data in case "file 
    system based" is selected as the cache layer below.
    </p><p>
    For most installations, it will be fine to set it to the default temp directory for the server 
    (/tmp on UNIX systems and C:\Windows\Temp for Windows system).
    </p><p>
    If your server has PHP Safe Mode enabled, you will need to create a directory under your 
    Phorum directory and make it writable by the web server (you can use the directory "./cache"
    which was included in the Phorum distribution for this purpose). Additionally, if you are
    running Phorum on a shared server, it is generally advantageous to use the "./cache" directory
    instead of "/tmp".
    </p><p>
    <span class="bold"><strong>Enable Caching stylesheet data (CSS):</strong></span>
    Phorum uses a system where modules can add data to the main stylesheet for the pages. 
    By enabling this feature, Phorum can cache the dynamically generated data and improve 
    caching of the stylesheet data in the browsers of your visitors. Enabling this 
    feature is highly recommended. Only disable it if you are having problems with it.

    <span class="bold"><strong>Enable Caching JavaScript code:</strong></span>
    Phorum uses a system where modules can provide JavaScript code for the pages. By enabling 
    this feature, Phorum can cache the dynamically generated data and improve caching of the 
    JavaScript data in the browsers of your visitors. Enabling this feature is highly recommended.
    Only disable it if you are having problems with it.

     Ban items can be used to deny new user registrations and posting of (private) messages, based on 
     various criteria. If a ban item applies to a user action, then this action will be fully blocked by
     Phorum. This can for example be used to block user registrations and postings from certain IP addresses
     or to prevent certain words from being used in forum messages.
     </p><p>
     If you want to fully ban a user, then it's best to set "Active" to "No" for the user in the "Edit Users"
     interface.
