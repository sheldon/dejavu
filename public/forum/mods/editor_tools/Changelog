Changelog:
----------

2008-06-04 v1.2.3

    - Added some improvements as suggested by David King (phorum.org
      user "Optimal") and Oliver Riesen.

      * prevented the textarea from jumping up when adding a tag to
        the body when the textarea is scrolled down a bit.

      * Selected text is now reselected after adding the tags to the
        textarea. The user can now use this to easily apply multiple
        tags to a piece of text, by clicking a few editor tools buttons
        without having to reselect the text.

      The new code was tested in Firefox 3, Opera 9.27 and MSIE 7.

2007-10-23 v1.2.2

    - Make use of the new css_register and javascript_register hooks.
      This requires Phorum 5.2.2 or newer.

2007-10-23 v1.2.1

    - Added Turkish language file.
      Thanks to Serdar of paticik.com.

2007-07-26 v1.2.0

    - Removed BBcode and smiley specific code from the module and moved
      that to respectively the BBcode and smileys modules. This allows
      the Editor Tools module to only be a framework that other modules
      can use to add tool bar buttons (this was the intentional design
      that I had in mind, but this could not be done because the module
      had to be compatible with Phorum 5.1 as well).

2007-07-09 v1.1.21

    - Fixed a minor CSS bug in the color picker code.

2007-07-08 v1.1.20

    - Fixed a bug that caused extra editor tool buttons to not show up.

2007-05-31 v1.1.19

    - Included a French translation by notre-planete.info. Thanks!

2007-04-11 v1.1.18

    - It's now possible to put the editor tools at a specific spot in the
      editor page, by creating a container element with id="editor-tools".
      The editor tools will automatically use that container for adding
      the buttons to the page.

2007-01-21 v1.1.17

    - Added ALT and TITLE attributes to the images in the smileys popup.

2007-01-15 v1.1.16

    - Corrected a bug which was introduced with version 1.1.15: the
      subject smileys did show all available smileys instead of only
      the ones that were allowed in the subject.

2007-01-13 v1.1.15

    - Fixed a problem with the javascript code which caused MSIE6 to
      show additional broken images in the smileys popup (known as
      the red crosses error).

2006-08-09 v1.1.14

    - Fixed wrong CSS declaration in colorpicker's CSS code
      (-moz-user-select:no instead of -moz-user-select:none).

    - Added updated czech language files (UTF8, WIN1250 and Latin-2 encoded)
      Thanks to CZVilda for the update.

    - Added localization support for the tab panels of the color picker.
      Thanks to CZVilda for the proposed code change.

2006-08-08 v1.1.13

    - Fixed a problem in the function editor_tools_construct_popup.
      The create_id wasn't used for generating the id of the content
      <div> of the popup window. This had no effect on the
      functionality of the editor tools.

    - Added extra languages to the distribution:
      * Swedish (by Per Mattsson)
        Beware: only the basic language file was translated, so there are
                no translated help files available in Swedish.
      * Italian (by Nicola)
      Thanks for the translation!

2006-07-31 v1.1.12

    - Some last fixes in editor_tools.php for using correct absolute URLs
      in an embedded environment. Also changed the way in which the
      colorpicker javascript is loaded. I now load it through the module
      php code, so paths in that javascript can be made absolute
      using $PHORUM["http_path"].
      I think (again ;-) that all embedding/portable issues are fixed now.
      Thanks milos for pointing me at the last couple of problems, to
      get them squeezed out.

    - BBcode help fix: most language file had a tag mismatch in them:
      [quote= .. ] .. [/color]. Thanks to James Hatts for the heads up!

    - Do not write tags to the textarea if the user presses Cancel on
      a second input prompt. Currently, the only second prompt is used
      for the description in creating URL links.

2006-07-27 v1.1.11

    - Added basic support for MSIE 5 and Netscape 7 on MacOS 9. Since
      these browsers are lacking functionality for selections and cursor
      positioning, the best I could do here is appending the tags to
      the end of the textarea contents.

      There was also an issue with the color picker on MSIE 5. Running
      the javascript code for building the popup window was way too heavy
      for the system. Somehow it even seemed to get stuck and hung.
      There were also some JavaScript compatibility problems. Based on all
      this, I decided to never display the color picker button on this
      browser.

      Thanks to CBiLL for contributing in the costs for a second-hand
      Powerbook G3 that I bought for working out the problems!

    - Added extra language to the distribution:
      * Czech (by Michal)
      Thanks for the translation!

    - Added Spanish and Finnish language updates.
      Thanks Diego and Panu!

2006-07-25 v1.1.10

    - Settings were added to the control panel to be able to change the
      size and horizontal placement of the smileys and the subject smileys
      popup windows. Using this, users can accomodate the the popup windows
      to the number of smileys that they have.

    - Added a second prompt for the [URL] tool to ask for a description of
      the link, in case no text has been selected.

    - A new language string was added: "enter url description".
      Updated language files for Finnish and Spanish (and of
      course additional translations) are welcome.

2006-07-24 v1.1.9

    - Added extra language to the distribution:
      * Spanish (by Diego)
      Thanks for the translation!

2006-07-20 v1.1.8

    - Added extra languages to the distribution:
      * Finnish (by Panu)
      * German (by Thomas Seifert)
      Thank you guys, for the translations!

    - Some more fixes for running in a portable / embedded setup.
      * The smileys are now visible in the popup window.
      * When registering editor tools from another module, their
        icon and jslib paths are resolved automatically to an
        absolute URL.

    - Some small changes to the help files.

    - Just http:// is no longer accepted for URL and image links.

2006-07-19 v1.1.7

    - Improved right justification of the help popup in some
      browsers.

    - Various fixes to make the module work correctly in a
      portable / embedded setup.

2006-07-18 v1.1.6

    - Added a z-index CSS property for the popups with a high value,
      to prevent them from popping up behind other page elements.

    - Changed all css classnames and javascript ids to not contain
      any underscores (thanks to Brian for the hint and pointer to
      http://www.htmlite.com/CSS003a.php).

    - Changed ".editor-tools-button" in the css to the more specific
      "#editor-tools .editor-tools-button", because it wasn't
      rendered correctly in some cases.

    - Fixes for color picker CSS in XHTML transitional pages
      viewed within MSIE. The tabs would not show up correctly
      without this fix (extra padding and top bar too small).
      Remark: this makes the tabs a bit off in XHTML strict
      pages. But since Phorum templates are XHTML transitional
      by default, I put this fix in the default package.

2006-07-17 v1.1.5

    - For MSIE, the active textarea selection is now stored before
      opening the color or text size popup and restored after
      a selection has been made. This is done, because MSIE loses
      the selection range when focus moves to another object.
      This caused for example the color code to be never around
      the selected text in MSIE.

2006-07-17 v1.1.4

    - Changed vertical aligment for the subject smiley button.

    - Bounding whitespace is now ignored when applying some bbcode
      to a selection. So instead of "this is [b]bold [/b] code"
      it will be "this is [b]bold[/b] code". Thanks to Milos for
      the idea.

    - Improved detection for checking if we are running on a page,
      containing an editor. The existing detection had a bug that
      caused a javascript warning about a missing textarea on
      posting confirmation and error pages. Thanks to Milos for
      pointing me at this problem.

2006-07-16 v1.1.3

    - Some small changes to make it easier to override and extend the
      editor tools from another module.

2006-07-15 v1.1.2

    - Added a popup for subject smileys. This one is disabled by default,
      so if you want this, enable subject smileys in the module settings.

    - Added a module settings screen. Here the administrator can configure
      which tools are enabled (bbcode, smileys, subject smileys and help).
      In case the bbcode module is enabled, you get extra fields to configure
      which bbcode tags (bold, italic, etc) are put in the editor tools.

    - Some small bugfixes.

2006-07-14 v1.1.1

    - Tool icon sizes are now explicitly set, for smoother loading.

2006-07-13 v1.1.0

    - Initial release.
