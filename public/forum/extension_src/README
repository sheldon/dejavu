Extension : Phorum 5 extension

This PHP extension is used for speeding up Phorum 5. Bottleneck functions
in the PHP code are implemented as pure C-code to gain as much speed as
possible.

Building on UNIX:
-----------------

You can install the Phorum extension on a UNIX system
using the following commands (asuming that you have a working
gcc build environment and phpize):

# php extract_constants.php
# phpize
# ./configure
# make
# make install

After installing the module, Phorum will automatically load the
extension from common.php. You can also add the following line to
your php.ini, so the module is loaded at startup:

extension=phorum.so


Building on Windows:
--------------------

I have no experience in building PHP extensions for Windows systems.
If you are interested in building the Phorum extension on such system,
then please contact me. If you have a working C compiler and are
capable of compiling PHP, then it should not be too difficult to
get this extension working.
